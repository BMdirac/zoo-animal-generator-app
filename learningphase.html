    <!-- 1. npm init: is used to create 'package.json' and it's 'scripts' dependency is changed to : "dev": "nodemon index.js" -->
    <!-- 2. npm install express: is used to install express -->
    <!-- 3. npm install nodemon --save-dev: is used to install nodemon -->
    <!-- 4. index.js file is created -->
    <!-- 5. public folder is created -->
    <!-- note that: here script.js is called client side js -->
    <!-- 1 - 5 is used to get the website running. this is finally achieve using: npm run dev-->

                                <!---------- Learning phase 2 (all about getting the api data) ----------->   
    <!-- note: "index.js" (server side) use get request to get data from api then
        "script.js" (client side) use get request to get the data
        from index.js to load it on the browser
    -->
    <!-- 6. npm install node-fetch is executed: so that data can be fetch while using node -->
    <!-- 7. .env file is created manually and is install using: npm install dotenv --save-dev;
        .env is used to hide our api key 
    -->

    <!-- Revision -->
    <!-- 
        ************************************
        app.get() is used in index.js (server side)
        but not in script.js (client side)

        ************************************
        const response = await fetch('/animalname'); is used 
        in script.js which is used to access the index.js data
        gotten from the api. 
        From this, it is clear that the data is access through
        the url "/animalname".
